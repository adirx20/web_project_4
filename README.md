**Intro**

* This is a project about some compact webpage which allow you to set your name, small details about yourself and watch photos with the possibility to like them.

**Sections**

* Header - Logo.
* Profile - Manage your account. Profile picture (avatar), name, profession and 'edit' and 'add' buttons.
* Elements - Upload your pictures. Images with titles and like buttons.
* Footer - Copyrights.
* Popup - Popup window that become visible after clicking the 'edit' button and let you change the name and the profession.
  I used Media queries to adjust the webpage to different devices.
  I wrote the webpage following BEM structure.
  I used JavaScript to make the edit and sumbit buttons work, and to toggle the 'popup' section's visibility.

**Future Upgrades**

* In the future I would like to make the 'like' button work (maybe even add a 'likes counter'), make the 'add' button work to allow the user upload images and change the avatar picture.
I would also like to connect the webpage to a server.
